Summary
-----
* Ph.D. Research: A decay with missing energy at the Belle II experiment (a B Meson Factory), Tsukuba, Japan
* Masters Research: Dark matter (axion & ALP) detection at the DEAP3600 detector, Sudbury, Canada

Extra-curriculars:
* The environment and ecology
* Equity, diversity and inclusivity in STEMM
* Outreach & science communication
