I am a high energy particle physics Ph.D. student at McGill University, working remotely at the Belle II Collaboration, Tsukuba, Japan. Belle II is a $B$ meson factory i.e. it produces many $B$ meson particles which analysts, like myself, can study. In my work I study the decay of a $B$ meson to a $D^{(\*)}$ meson, a lepton and its corresponding neutrino. This is a high profile particle decay due its to contribution to a variable called $R(D^{(\*)})$. Physicists have calculated this value theoretically and measured it experimentally, however the two values don't match! Either theory or experiment is incorrect. If experiment is wrong, we need to fix the issues and measure $R(D^{(\*)})$ more precisely. If theory is wrong, i.e. our model for calculating $R(D^{(\*)})$ is wrong, that means that there are effects theory does not account for. This then means there could be more particles that exist outside of the ones we know today, including exciting Dark Matter candidates! My work contributes to measuring $R(D^{(\*)})$ more precisely, to conclude whether it is theory that is incorrect or previous experimental results that were not precise enough.
