Hi! I am a postdoctoral research assistant specialising in particle accelerator environmental sustainability at the [John Adams Institute for Accelerator Science](https://www.adams-institute.ac.uk/), University of Oxford.

In the first 3 years of my postdoc, I worked jointly with the [ISIS Neutron and Muon Source](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx) at the [Rutherford Appleton Laboratory](https://www.ukri.org/who-we-are/stfc/facilities/rutherford-appleton-laboratory/) in the UK. I spent the majority of my research time working on evaluating the environmental impact of [ISIS-II](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/ISIS-II.aspx) -- the proposed upgrade to the ISIS project -- from construction to decommission, via a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). In this I identified the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions of key accelerator components, I assessed the carbon footprint of proposed technologies, and I considered other environmental impacts such. I then worked to reduce the environmental impact of building, operating and decommissioning large accelerator facilities like ISIS-II.

I am a member of the [Sustainable HECAP+](https://hecap.eco) initiative. This grassroots initiative has many ongoing projects; in March 2025 we published ["Environmental sustainability in basic research. A perspective from HECAP+"](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/20/03/P03012), which may also be [endorsed](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1293733/) by supporters.

Outside of my research I am an advocate for equity and inclusion, I enjoy teaching, and I work towards making research and academia in general more environmentally sustainable. I am an [IUPAP Accelerator Engagement Ambassador](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/iupap-accelerator-science-communication_the-international-particle-accelerator-community-activity-7423847620231716864-nJ1u?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABQSuH0B8ejvUZ3lA559I-HMcy3qp52v_48); in this role I can bring a talk on particle accelerators and environmental sustainability to your schools, communities or events (contact me!). I am an organiser of the [Sustainable High Energy Physics Workshop](https://indico.global/event/4745/), a member of the [Laboratory Directors Group (LDG) Working Group on the Sustainability Assessment of Accelerators](https://ldg.web.cern.ch/working-groups/sustainability-assessment-of-accelerators), and a member of the [Oxford Physics Gender Equity Network Committee](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/about-us/equality-diversity-and-inclusion/oxford-physics-gender-equity-network).

I completed my Ph.D. in high energy particle physics at McGill University, Montreal in 2023. In this I worked remotely at the Belle II Collaboration, Japan and collaborated in an 1000+ strong international collaboration. <!-- I also received authorship qualification for more than 60 papers from 2019-2024! -->
