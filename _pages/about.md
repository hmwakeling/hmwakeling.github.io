I am a postdoctoral research assistant in particle accelerator environmental sustainability at the [John Adams Institute for Accelerator Science](https://www.adams-institute.ac.uk/), University of Oxford. I work jointly with the [ISIS Neutron and Muon Source](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx) at the [Rutherford Appleton Laboratory](https://www.ukri.org/who-we-are/stfc/facilities/rutherford-appleton-laboratory/) in the UK.

I spend the majority of my research time working on evaluating the environmental impact of [proposed future upgrades to the ISIS project](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/ISIS-II.aspx), from construction to decommission. In this I identify the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions of key accelerator components, I assess the carbon footprint of proposed technologies, and I consider other environmental impacts such as a raw material extraction, transport, and impacts on biodiversity. I also then work to reduce the environmental impact of building a facility such as ISIS-II. 

I am also a member of the [sustainability in HECAP+ grassroots initiative](https://sustainable-hecap-plus.github.io/). We recently published a document on sustainability in HECAP+, which can be endorsed by supporters. 

I completed my Ph.D. in high energy particle physics at McGill University, Montreal in 2023. In this I worked remotely at the Belle II Collaboration, Japan and collaborated in an 1000+ strong international collaboration.
