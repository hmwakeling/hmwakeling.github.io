I am a postdoctoral research assistant in particle accelerator environmental sustainability at the John Adams Institute for Accelerator Science, University of Oxford. I work jointly with the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source at the Rutherford Appleton laboratory in the UK.

I spend the majority of my research time working on evaluating the environmental impact of proposed future upgrades to the ISIS project, from construction to decommission. In this I identify the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions of key accelerator components, I assess the carbon footprint of proposed technologies, and I consider other environmental impacts such as a raw material extraction, transport, and impacts on biodiversity.

I am also a member of the [sustainability in HECAP+ grassroots initiative](https://sustainable-hecap-plus.github.io/).

I completed my Ph.D. in high energy particle physics at McGill University, Montreal in 2023. In this I worked remotely at the Belle II Collaboration, Japan and collaborated in an 1000+ strong international collaboration.
