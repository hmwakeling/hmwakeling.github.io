I am a postdoctoral research assistant in particle accelerator environmental sustainability at the [John Adams Institute for Accelerator Science](https://www.adams-institute.ac.uk/), University of Oxford. I work jointly with the [ISIS Neutron and Muon Source](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx) at the [Rutherford Appleton Laboratory](https://www.ukri.org/who-we-are/stfc/facilities/rutherford-appleton-laboratory/) in the UK.

I spend the majority of my research time working on evaluating the environmental impact of [proposed future upgrades to the ISIS project](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/ISIS-II.aspx), from construction to decommission, via a Life Cycle Assessment. In this I identify the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions of key accelerator components, I assess the carbon footprint of proposed technologies, and I consider other environmental impacts such as a raw material extraction, transport, and impacts on biodiversity. I also then work to reduce the environmental impact of building, operating and decommissioning large accelerator facilities. 

I am also a member of the [sustainability in HECAP+ initiative](https://hecap.eco). This grassroots initiative has many ongoing projects. In March 2025 we published ["Environmental sustainability in basic research. A perspective from HECAP+"](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/20/03/P03012), which may also be [endorsed](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1293733/) by supporters.

I completed my Ph.D. in high energy particle physics at McGill University, Montreal in 2023. In this I worked remotely at the Belle II Collaboration, Japan and collaborated in an 1000+ strong international collaboration.
