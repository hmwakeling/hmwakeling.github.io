<h2>The Sustainable HECAP+ Initiative</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://hecap.eco">Sustainable HECAP+ initiative</a> is a grassroots initiative consisting of scientists in the High Energy Physics, Cosmology, Astroparticle Physics, and Hadron and Nuclear Physics (HECAP+) communities who are concerned about the climate crisis and advocating for a transition towards fairer and more sustainable practices in our fields. We want to limit the impact of our research on the world’s climate and ecosystems by striving for a sustainable and just future. We formed this initiative after the first Sustainable High Energy Physics workshop that was held back in 2021. We wanted a tangible outcome of the workshop and so came together (completely remotely!) to write a reflection document. 2 years later we made “Environmental sustainability in basic research: a perspective from HECAP+” public on UN World Environment Day 2023, and we expect publication in JINST in the coming months. In the document we aim to reflect on the environmental impacts of our fields, highlight best practice and provide recommendations to individuals, groups and institutions to make positive changes.

<p>Version 2.0 of our reflection document is <a href="https://hecap.eco">available to download</a>. It is also possible to endorse the document as an individual or an organisation.</p>
