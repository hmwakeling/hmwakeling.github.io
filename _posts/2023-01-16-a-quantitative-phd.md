Throughout my Ph.D. I have been keeping track, purposely or inadvertantly, of what I've been up to.

I started my Ph.D. on September 1st 2017. Today, marks the date of the end of my Ph.D. Today I defended my thesis in a 2 hour oral examination. That I will talk about in another post. This post is the statistics of my 2005 day project. 5 years, 5 months and 26 days later, what have I accomplished?

Hours worked roughly:
Typically I was able to take weekends and able to stick to roughly 8 hour work days.

Vacation taken:
47 officially booked off.
Assuming 15 days vacation a year, I should have taken 75 days.
During the COVID pandemic, I believe I made up for these missing vacation days. They, however, were necessary mental health days in a time where it felt like the world was about to end. I was not running about having fun; I was keeping tabs on family, friends and myself.

Super computer CPU hours used:

Thesis words per day:
Total: 36263
108 active days writing
335.8 words per day with a peak of 668 words written in one day.
