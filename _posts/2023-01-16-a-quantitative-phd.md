Throughout my Ph.D. I have been keeping track of what I've been up to. This was mainly inadvertantly, but at one point it became a fun project.

I started my Ph.D. on September 1st 2017 and today, February 27th 2023, marks the date of the end of my Ph.D. I defended my thesis in a 2 hour oral examination as is the standard in McGill Physics. This post is contains some quantative information from my 2005 day Ph.D.

5 years, 5 months and 26 days later, what have I accomplished?

Hours worked roughly:

Typically I was able to take weekends and like to think that I was able to stick to roughly 8 hour work days, however I'm quite certain I had some 10-12 hour workdays and other days that looked more like 4 hours.

Vacation taken:

47 days officially booked off.

Assuming that I should have taken 15 days of vacation a year, 47/75 days was not a good rate. HOWEVER, during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, I believe I made up for these missing vacation days. Not that necessary mental health days count as vacation in a time where it felt like the world was about to end. I was keeping tabs on family, friends, myself and my animal crossing island inhabitants.

Super computer CPU hours used: I have still to sift through this data.
