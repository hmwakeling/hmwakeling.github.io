“Environmental Sustainability R&D for Particle Accelerators” summer internship opportunity for undergraduate physics students from UK universities!

Please follow this link for details, eligibility and how to apply: [https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/subdepartment/particle-physics/particle-physics-summer-internship-programme](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/subdepartment/particle-physics/particle-physics-summer-internship-programme)

Advert (also found at the link):

As the global need for environmental sustainability grows, the responsibility to design and manufacture particle accelerator facilities with environmental responsibility increases too. The John Adams Institute (JAI) – a UK centre of excellence in advanced and novel accelerator technology – is at the forefront of evaluating the environmental impact of accelerator systems and components. This JAI project offers a unique opportunity for an intern to contribute to this field. The intern would:

- develop models to assess the environmental impact of accelerator technologies using tools like Python and OpenLCA.
- identify opportunities to reduce emissions, energy use, and material consumption in accelerator design.
- pursue independent research, with some freedom to shape part of the project around their own interests.

Applicants are welcomed to submit a research area of focus within their application. Prior experience in Python and Jupyter notebooks would be beneficial but are not essential – training and support can be provided as part of the project.

Deadline: Monday 7th April 2025

Please note that applications must be submitted through the official route.
