Wearing my hat as a co-organiser of the Sustainable High-Energy Physics (HEP) Conference for the 2nd year, I'm sharing -- once again -- a short post about this wonderful event (if I say so myself!).

This year we hosted SustainableHEP online with the kind provision of services from CERN, the John Adams Institute and the Particle Physics Department of Oxford. I won't go into detail about the concept behind Sustainable HEP (see [this post on last year's edition](/posts/2024-06-12-sustHEP/), but we opted for an entirely online format again. We did consider the possibility for an in-person conference, in multiple different forms, but ultimately decided to continue with the online format with high accessibility and low environmental (and financial) costs.

The goal of Sustainable HEP is to improve the intersection and overlap of HEP and environmental sustainability through providing a platform for those interested to share their work, ideas, and events, and to improve communication and grow networks. Through this, we aim to foster further discussions and initiatives that pave the way for a more environmentally sustainable future in scientific research.

Alongside the fantastic submitted talks, we hosted incredible keynote speakers, and ran not one, but _two_ panels with representatives from large research institutes discussing their environmental efforts. Ultimately, I believe that the discussions and shared work made the event a resounding success.
