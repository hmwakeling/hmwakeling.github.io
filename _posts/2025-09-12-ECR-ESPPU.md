Thanks to months of collaboration and effort from early career researchers (ECRs) across Europe, we shall be submitting a 10-page executive summary of "Early Career Researcher Input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update: White Paper" to the upcoming European Strategy for Particle Physics Update (ESPPU). This comes with fifty-five recommendations for the future of Particle Physics following an ECR survey, which received over 900 responses!

My personal favourite recommendation quote: "The next flagship collider should be built and run in the most sustainable way."

If you are an ECR, it is possible to endorse the document! Contact me for more details.
