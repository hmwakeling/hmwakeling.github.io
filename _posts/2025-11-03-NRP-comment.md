Our Comment on "Community-specific guidance for environmental sustainability in particle accelerators" has just been published with Springer Nature in [Volume 7 Issue 11](https://www.nature.com/natrevphys/volumes/7/issues/11) of Nature Reviews Physics!

We share how community specific environmental sustainability guidance could help address the climate crisis within research and beyond. We also highlight our living document - "High-level environmental sustainability guidelines for large accelerator facilities" - in which we start that process.
