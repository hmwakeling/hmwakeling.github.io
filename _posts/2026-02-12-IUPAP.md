Excited to share that I've been chosen to be a part of the IUPAP Accelerator Ambassadors initiative and to be part of such a magnificent team!

The international particle accelerator community, represented by IUPAP Working Group 14 (Accelerator Science) started this initiative this year and have 6 ambassadors hailing from across the globe. Each of our projects will focus on different areas in accelerator science.
