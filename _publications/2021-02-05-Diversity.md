These proceedings accompany the Belle II talk in the Diversity and Inclusion parallel session delivered during ICHEP 2020. This marks the first external presentation by the Belle II Collaboration, in which we present some of our data and self-reported statistics regarding diversity and inclusion. We also present Belle II's current and planned activities to aid and improve diversity and inclusion. We find that there is still a lot to be done to improve the social working environment and population representation within our collaboration and within high energy physics.
