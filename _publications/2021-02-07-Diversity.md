The Belle II Collaboration comprises over 1000 international high energy physicists, who investigate the properties of b-quarks and other particles at the luminosity frontier. In order to achieve our aim of a successful physics program, it is essential that we emphasise contributions from a diverse community. Belle II has thus far focused on diversity in gender and sexuality, among other efforts within our collaboration. These efforts are led by our two Diversity Officers, elected to the newly created positions in 2018. Their role has been to promote an inclusive atmosphere, raising awareness of diversity and being a safe first point of call for issues of discrimination and harassment. These proceedings accompany the short talk delivered during ICHEP 2020, marking the first conference the Belle II Collaboration has presented in the diversity and inclusion stream. It details the efforts described above, as well as examining the evolving gender demographics of our community, since membership began in 2011.
