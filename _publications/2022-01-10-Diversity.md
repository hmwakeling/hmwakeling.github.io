These proceedings accompany the Belle II talk in the Science in Society parallel session delivered during Lepton Photon 2021. In this talk we present updated membership statistics using 10 years of data with a diversity and inclusion lens, and we present Belle II's most recent activities to aid and improve diversity and inclusion. This report has the intention to bring light to the social working environment and population representation within our collaboration and, by extension, within high energy physics.
Belle II is a particle physics collaboration that has over 1000 people from institutions in 26 countries who work together to achieve its physics goals. Belle II is committed to fostering an open, diverse, and inclusive environment; as part of this commitment it created a diversity office to raise awareness of diversity and inclusion issues, promote an inclusive atmosphere within the collaboration, provide a safe and confidential point to contact for collaborators to report any issues, particularly those related to discrimination and harassment, and ensure that persons from underrepresented groups are considered for positions of responsibility within the collaboration. Diversity and inclusion activities and initiatives at Belle II and analysis of the demographics of the collaboration will be presented.
