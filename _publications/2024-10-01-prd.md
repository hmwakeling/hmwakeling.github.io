The ratio of branching fractions $R(D^{(∗)})$=$\mathcal{B}$$(B^- \rightarrow D^* \tau^- \bar{\nu}_\tau)/$$\mathcal{B}$$(B^-\rightarrow D^* l^- \bar{\nu}_l)$, where $l$ is an electron or muon, is measured using a Belle II data sample with an integrated luminosity of 189 fb$^{-1}$ at the SuperKEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+ e^-$ collider. Data is collected at the $\Upsilon$(4S) resonance, and one B meson in the $\Upsilon$(4S)$\rightarrow B \bar{B}$ decay is fully reconstructed in hadronic decay modes. The accompanying signal B meson is reconstructed as $B^-\rightarrow D^* \tau^- \bar{\nu}_\tau$ using leptonic $\tau$ decays. The normalization decay, $B^-\rightarrow D^* l^- \bar{\nu}_l$, produces the same observable final-state particles. The ratio of branching fractions is extracted in a simultaneous fit to two signal-discriminating variables in both channels and yields $R(D^{(∗)})=0.262_{-0.039}^{+0.041}$(stat)$_{-0.032}^{+0.035}$(syst). This result is consistent with the current world average and with Standard Model predictions.
