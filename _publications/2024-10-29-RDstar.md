The ratio of branching fractions $R(D^*) = \mathcal{B}(\bar{B}\rightarrow D^* \tau^- \bar{\nu}_\tau)/\bar{B}\rightarrow D^* \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell)$, where $\ell$ is an electron or muon, is measured using a Belle II data sample with an integrated luminosity of 189fb$^−1$ at the SuperKEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider. Data is collected at the $\Upsilon$(4S) resonance, and one $B$ meson in the $\Upsilon$(4S)$\rightarrow B\bar{B} decay is fully reconstructed in hadronic decay modes. The accompanying signal $B$ meson is reconstructed as $\bar{B}\rightarrow D^* \tau^- \bar{\nu}_\tau$ using leptonic $\tau$ decays. The normalization decay, \bar{B}\rightarrow D^* \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell, produces the same observable final-state particles. The ratio of branching fractions is extracted in a simultaneous fit to two signal-discriminating variables in both channels and yields $R(D^*)$ =$0.262^{+0.041}_{−0.039}$(stat)$^{+0.035}_{−0.032}$(syst). This result is consistent with the current world average and with Standard Model predictions.
