The "Workshop on Sustainable High Energy Physics" was first held in 2021 as an international initiative to promote sustainability awareness within the physics community. This workshop series has been organised by early and mid-career researchers and conducted as a virtual three-day event in the years 2021, 2022, and 2024. This proceeding will highlight key take-away points from the third edition of the workshop held in 2024 (indico.cern.ch/e/susthep24), featuring keynote lectures and contributed talks that encompass a diverse range of topics in high-energy physics. The goal of the workshop was to focus on the long-term environmental impacts of research facilities, computing, and the challenges faced by researchers and institutions, while also offering a platform for proposed solutions to tackle climate change.
