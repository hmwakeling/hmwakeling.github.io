The proposed construction of new particle accelerator-based facilities in the coming decades -- and upgrades to existing facilities -- provides the unique opportunity to embed innovative environmental impact reduction techniques into their design. This living document provides high-level guidelines to improve environmental sustainability in the planning, construction, operational and decommissioning stages of large accelerator facilities. A collection of various resources is provided, with examples of some existing and suggested practices.
