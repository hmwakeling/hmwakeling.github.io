The Large Particle Physics Laboratory Directors Group (LDG) established the Working Group on the Sustainability Assessment of Future Accelerators in 2024 with the mandate to develop guidelines and a list of key parameters for the assessment of the sustainability of future accelerators in particle physics. While focused on accelerator projects, much of the work will also be relevant to other current and future Research Infrastructures. The development and continuous update of such a framework aim to enable a coherent communication amongst scientists and adequately convey the information to a broader set of stakeholders.
This document outlines the major findings and recommendations from the LDG Sustainability WG report - a summary of current best practices recommended to be adopted by new Research Infrastructures. The full report will be available in June 2025 at: [this https URL](https://ldg.web.cern.ch/working-groups/sustainability-assessment-of-accelerators). Not all of sustainability topics are addressed at the same level. The assessment process is complex, largely under development and a homogeneous evaluation of all the aspects deserves a strategy to be pursued over time.
