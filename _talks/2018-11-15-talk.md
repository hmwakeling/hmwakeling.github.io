A public talk on anti-matter and how it appears in our daily lives.

Abstract: Ever since the antiproton was predicted in 1933 and discovered in 1955, we’ve wondered about the possibility of antimatter planets or galaxies, and we’ve even considered what the universe would be like if it were made of antimatter. But what actually is antimatter? Figuring that out will be the first step of the evening, followed by us attempting to answer questions such as:

* Given that galaxies are separated by space, is it possible they could be made of antimatter?

* If our universe is only made of matter, then where did all of the antimatter go?

Come along to see how antimatter appears in our daily lives without most of us even realising it. Plus, find out how we can use antimatter in colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider and SuperKEKB to search for the truth about beginning of the Universe!
