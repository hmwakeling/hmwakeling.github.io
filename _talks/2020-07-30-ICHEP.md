Abstract:
Belle II is an international collaboration that has over 1000 members
from institutions in 26 countries. In 2018 Belle II created two posts
of diversity officers, to raise awareness of diversity and inclusion
issues, promote an inclusive atmosphere within the collaboration,
provide a safe and confidential point to contact for collaborators to
report any issues, particularly those related to discrimination and
harassment, and ensure that persons from underrepresented groups are
considered for positions of responsibility within the collaboration. We
will show how the demographics of the Belle II collaboration have
evolved, and discuss diversity and inclusion activities and initiatives
undertaken in Belle II.
