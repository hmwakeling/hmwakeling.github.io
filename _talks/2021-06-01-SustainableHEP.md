A flash-talk given at the first edition of Sustianable HEP.

Abstract: 
We are all here for a sustainable HEP. But what does sustainability mean? It does not mean less carbon emitted—it means a genuinely circular way of living in the world. HEP depends on complex computing infrastructure and large devices which are made of metal mined from the earth that cannot always be recycled. All HEP infrastructure emits carbon. Climate change is urgent. Is particle physics? Particle physics might not be ending any time soon. What can be done to make it circular? Is it possible? We need more information in addition to immediate action. In this talk, we will elaborate on the environmental impact of HEP, the areas where we need to know more, and immediate action that can and should be taken to address environmental impact beyond flights
