A talk on behalf of the Belle II Collaboration on the latest diversity and inclusion activities from Belle II experiment.


Abstract:
Belle II is a particle physics collaboration that has over 1000 people
from institutions in 26 countries who work together to achieve its
physics goals. Belle II is committed to fostering an open, diverse, and
inclusive environment; as part of this commitment it created a diversity
office to raise awareness of diversity and inclusion issues, promote an
inclusive atmosphere within the collaboration, provide a safe and
confidential point to contact for collaborators to report any issues,
particularly those related to discrimination and harassment, and ensure
that persons from underrepresented groups are considered for positions
of responsibility within the collaboration. Diversity and inclusion
activities and initiatives at Belle II and analysis of the demographics
of the collaboration will be presented.
