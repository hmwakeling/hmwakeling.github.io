A introductory talk on the proposed efforts to evaluate the environmental impact of ISIS-II.

Abstract: 
The ISIS-II Neutron and Muon Source is the next generation of, and successor to, the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source based at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the United Kingdom. Proposed to begin construction sometime after 2030, ISIS-II will have the rare yet exciting opportunity to embed environmental sustainability into the early stages of the design process. One instance of this is to use Life Cycle Assessments to investigate the environmental impacts of different ISIS-II design options at various phases of the project. This talk will introduce the first efforts of performing a Life Cycle Assessment at ISIS-II and discuss the next strategic steps.
