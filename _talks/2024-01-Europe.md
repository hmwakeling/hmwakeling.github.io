A summary talk on the efforts on evaluating the environmental impact of ISIS-II. Various renditions and versions were presented at ESS, DESY, CERN and ILL.

Abstract: 
With growing concerns about the impact of the climate crisis on the environment and life as we know it, researchers are increasing efforts in understanding and reducing the environmental impact of basic science research. Within this context, the proposed next generation of the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source, called "ISIS-II", is currently being modelled to determine its full lifetime environmental impact. In addition, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology will be used to compare various design options of ISIS-II with the view to inform future decisions. In this talk I will introduce the proposed ISIS-II facility, present the methodology of these impact studies, and discuss their progress.
