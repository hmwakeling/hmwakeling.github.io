A seminar on evaluating the environmental impact of ISIS-II.

Abstract: 
The ISIS-II Neutron and Muon Source is the proposed next generation of, and successor to, the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source based at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the United Kingdom. Construction is estimated to begin sometime after 2030 and, as such, ISIS-II will have the rare yet exciting opportunity to embed environmental sustainability into the early stages of its design process. One instance of this is to use a Life Cycle Assessment to investigate the environmental impacts of different ISIS-II design options. This talk will introduce the first efforts of performing a Life Cycle Assessment at ISIS-II, present some preliminary results, and discuss the next strategic steps.
