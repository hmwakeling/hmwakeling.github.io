A talk aimed at opening the discussion on efforts needed at the proposed ISIS-II facility in terms of power converters.

Abstract: The ISIS-II Neutron and Muon source is the proposed next generation of, and successor to, the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source based at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the United Kingdom. Anticipated to start construction around 2032, the ISIS-II project presents a unique opportunity to incorporate environmental sustainability practices from its inception. At this point in time, the ISIS-II project is undergoing feasibility evaluations, design studies and research and development, making it an ideal phase to consider and mitigate the future environmental impacts of ISIS-II. Multiple efforts are underway to assess the environmental impacts associated with each ISIS-II design option throughout the stages of the entire ISIS-II project lifecycle. This presentation will introduce the ISIS-II project and outline the opportunities under consideration for improved sustainability, with a focus on power converters.
