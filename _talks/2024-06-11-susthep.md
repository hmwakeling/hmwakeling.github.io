A summary talk on the efforts on evaluating the environmental impact of ISIS-II.

Abstract: The ISIS-II Neutron and Muon source is the proposed next generation of, and successor to, the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source based at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the United Kingdom. Anticipated to start construction in 2032, the ISIS-II project presents a unique opportunity to incorporate environmental sustainability practices from its inception.
As part of the optioneering and design process of ISIS-II, I am examining the environmental impact of the facility through carbon impact estimation and through a (simplified) Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). I will present these efforts and discuss the methodology, including how we are overcoming some of the difficulties in performing such an analysis.
