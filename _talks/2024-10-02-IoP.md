Particle accelerators are vital for medical applications, scientific discovery and technological development, but they generally come with significant environmental impacts. As the climate crisis intensifies, can we design and operate accelerators with greater environmental responsibility? Can this be achieved without hindering scientific progress â€” and could accelerators even help address some environmental challenges?

Part of the IOP London and South East (LSE) region autumn/winter 2024 General Public Physics Talk Series.

Tea/coffee served from 18:00-18:30.

Lecture starts: 18:30 for approx. 1hr (with 15mins for questions).

The lecture is free and open to all but registration is required.
