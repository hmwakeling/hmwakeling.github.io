How do particle accelerators intersect with the climate crisis, and why we should we care? Is it possible to design and operate accelerators more sustainably without hindering scientific progress? This talk will explore these questions, focusing on how — as the climate crisis intensifies — researchers are evaluating, reducing and mitigating these impacts through innovative and exciting approaches.
